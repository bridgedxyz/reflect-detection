## Pattern detection
> If same structure is repeated in the same level tree, By definition, That is a pattern.


*There are two cases of pattern detection.*

### A - Repeated Component


### B - Repeated Structure

Since it is detecting a repeated "Structure", we only process node with more thant 3 childrens. Otherwise, it may detect a non-pattern as a pattern.
